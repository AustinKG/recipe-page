    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C)</li>
        <li><b>Make the crust:</b> Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a
            medium
            bowl and
            stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the food
            processor.)
            Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch
            springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the
            crust down
            tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of
            aluminum
            foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool
            as you
            prepare the filling.</li>
        <li><b>Make the filling:</b> Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the
            cream
            cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is
            smooth and
            creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully
            combined. On medium speed, add the eggs on at a time, beating after each addition until just
            blended. After
            the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from
            deflating
            and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.</li>
        <li><b>Prepare the simple water bath (see note)</b> Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in
            your
            roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water.
            As the
            water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on
            top of
            the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan inside of a
            large
            roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can
            place the
            roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)</li>
        <li>Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When it's done, the center of
            the
            cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven
            door
            slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove
            from the
            oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate the
            cheesescake
            for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the
            rim. Using
            a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip into
            warm
            water between each slice.</li>
        <li>Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for
            up to 5
            days.</li>
